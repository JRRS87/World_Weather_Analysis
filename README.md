# World_Weather_Analysis

In this proyect we are going to Generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieve the nearest city, 
and perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. And Retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then, 
create a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data.

Will demostrate input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences, then use those preferences to identify 
potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up 
markers.

We use Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen from the
customerâ€™s possible travel destinations. Then, create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on 
the itinerary.
